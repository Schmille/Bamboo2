# Bamboo 2: Modded Boogaloo

#### General information
I initially created this mod when I found out that you can not compost Bamboo in 1.14. 

Then I thought "Isn't Bamboo edible?", so I looked it up and confirmed that there are *some* edible species of bamboo.

##### This small mod changes/adds the following:
 * Bamboo can now be composted
    * Composting amount can be configured
    * Can be disabled in config
 * Bamboo can be eaten raw
    * Can be disabled in config
    * applies slow effect by default
    * slow effect can be configured/disabled
 * Bamboo can be cooked in the furnace
    * Can be disabled in config
